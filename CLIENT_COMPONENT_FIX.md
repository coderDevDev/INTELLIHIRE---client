# Client Component Static Export Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Error**: `Page "/dashboard/admin/jobs/[id]/edit/page" cannot use both "use client" and export function "generateStaticParams()"`

**Solution**: Removed `generateStaticParams()` from all `'use client'` components.

## 🎯 Why This Works

- **`generateStaticParams()`** is a server-side function
- **`'use client'`** components run on the client side
- **Next.js doesn't allow** mixing server and client functions
- **For static export**, we don't need `generateStaticParams()` with client-side routing

## 📁 What We Did

Removed `generateStaticParams()` from these files:

- ✅ `app/dashboard/admin/applicants/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/dashboard/admin/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/dashboard/admin/jobs/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/jobs/[jobId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/jobs/[jobId]/apply/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/jobs/category/[categoryId]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/verify-email/[token]/page.tsx`

## 🚀 How Dynamic Routes Work Now

1. **Static export** generates HTML for static routes
2. **`_redirects` file** ensures all requests serve `index.html`
3. **Client-side routing** handles ALL dynamic routes
4. **API calls** fetch data based on URL parameters

## ✅ Result

- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ All dynamic routes work via client-side routing
- ✅ Ready for Render.com deployment
- ✅ No server-side pre-generation needed

Your app is now ready to deploy! 🎉
